Use this menu to select the desired function. If you have problems navigating in this help system, press F1 to enter the helpinkcazelo of the help system. The main functions in this menu are:
harddiskMisela Inkqubo Kwiqokobhe Lekhompyutha: This selection will not do anything to the system. It only starts a previously installed operating system.
linuxUkuhlohla: This installation mode works on most machines. If you experience a system freeze during boot or problems with detection of your hardware components, such as disk controllers or network cards, try one of the following installation options.
noacpiUkuhlohlwa kwe--ACPI Kususwe Isakhono: Many of the currently-sold computers have incomplete or faulty ACPI implementations. This selection disables ACPI support in the kernel, but still enables many performance features, like DMA for IDE hard disks.
nolapicUkuhlohlwa kwe--APIC Yendawo Leyo Kususwe Isakhono: If the normal installation fails, this might be due to the system hardware not supporting local APIC. If this seems to be the case, use this option to install without local APIC support.
failsafeImimiselo Yokuhlohla -- Ikhuselekile: If you were not successful with Ukuhlohla, this selection might solve the issue.
rescueIsixokelelwano Sokuhlangula: This boot image starts a small Linux system in RAM. This is useful if the system does not start properly. After booting this system, log in as root.
firmwareUvavanyo lwe-Firmware: Runs a BIOS test tool that validates ACPI and other parts of your BIOS.
memtestUvavanyo Lukavimba Wolwazi: Memory testing is useful for more than checking installation of new memory modules. It is a stress test for a big part of your computer system and may indicate hardware problems.
optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo: The boot options may change the behavior of your system completely. They are settings for the kernel.
helpF1 Help: This is context sensitive. It will show different screens depending on the active element of the boot screen. There is also a description of this help system available.
keytableF2: Set language and keyboard mapping used by the boot loader.
videomodeF3 Video Mode: Here, choose between different screen resolutions while installing. If you encounter problems with the graphical installation, the imo yokusebenza ngesiqendu may be a work-around for you.
install_srcF4 Installation Source: Choose the installation source.
driverupdateF6 Driver Update: For very new machines, a driver update may be needed to install the system.bitsOkukhethiweyo Kohlobo Lokungaphakathi EkhompyutheniYou have the choice to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of KDE.

There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are found, although most of memory defects will be found.
Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.noacpiUkuhlohlwa kwe--ACPI Kususwe IsakhonoCurrent hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) to control the interrupt handling. ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
Select Ukuhlohlwa kwe--ACPI Kususwe Isakhono if you encounter problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that have problems with ACPI are: 
  • kernel freezes when booting  • PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly
You may also try the firmwareUvavanyo lwe-Firmware boot option and look at the test results of the ACPI validation.
Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.nolapicUkuhlohlwa kwe--APIC Yendawo Leyo Kususwe IsakhonoNormally there are no problems with the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). But if you seem to have some, try this option to boot without local APIC support.
Please don't confuse this with noacpii-ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).

a) installer options 
  • o_installhlohla -- select an installation source  • networkizikhethwa zomsebenzi wothungelwano -- the network options  • o_vncIzikhethwa ze-vnc -- options for installation via VNC
b) kernel options 
  • o_splashtshiza -- influence the behavior of the splash screen  • o_apmi-apm -- toggle power management  • o_acpii-acpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_idei-ide -- control the IDE subsystem
Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.o_hostipo_netmasko_gatewaynetworkIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: Izikhethwa Zomsebenzi WothungelwanoIt is possible to configure the network interface right now. The hardware will be detected later by YaST2. The minimum set of options to configure your network card consists of host IP and netmask. For example: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10 netmask=255.255.255.0
or in a shorter form: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10/24
If you specified a o_installukuhlohla okusekwe kumsebenzi wothungelwano and do not specify both of these options, the installer tries to configure the network interface with i-dhcp. If you need a default gateway, specify this with the option Indlela yesango. For example: 
  • indlela yesango=192.168.0.8
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_acpiIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, i-acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • i-pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • i-acpi=umiselolwakudala -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • i-acpi=imo yokungasebenzi -- switch off ACPI completely  • i-acpi=yonyanzelo -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmi-apm system.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_apmIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-apmAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • i-apm=imo yokungasebenzi -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpii-ACPI.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_ideIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: i-ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • i-ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drives
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_installIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: hlohlaBy default, the local CD-ROMs are searched for the installation source. For a network install, select the hlohla option. Possible installation protocols are 
  • FTP  • NFS  • HTTP
The syntax to use is just like standard URLs. For example, if your server is found at 192.168.0.1 and you want to do an NFS-based install from the directory /install on this server, specify the source as follows: 
  • ukuhlohla=nfs://192.168.0.1/ukuhlohla
The network card will either be configured with i-dhcp or you must specify the parameters yourself as described in the networkizikhethwa zomsebenzi wothungelwano.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_splashIzikhethwa ze-Kernel: tshizaThe splash screen is the picture shown during system start-up. 
  • tshiza=0 -- The splash screen is switched off. This may be useful with very old monitors or if some error occurs.  • tshiza=umlembelele -- Activates splash, kernel and boot messages are still shown.  • tshiza=ngokuthula -- Activates splash, but no messages. Instead a progress bar is drawn.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.o_vncpasswordo_vncIzikhethwa Zomhlohli: i-vncTo enable the VNC installation, specify the parameters vnc and vncpassword: 
  • vnc=1 vncigamalokugqithisa=umzekelo
The VNC server will be started and you may control YaST2 over any VNC client from a remote system.
Buyela optIzikhethwa Zomiselo Lwenkqubo.rescueIsixokelelwano SokuhlangulaThe Isixokelelwano Sokuhlangula is a small RAM disk base system. From there, it is possible to make all kinds of changes to an installed system. Because only low-level tools are available in this system, it is intended for experts.
Buyela mainUncedo Lomlayishi Womiselo Lwenkqubo.videomodeOkukhethwayo Kwimo YevidiyoPress F3 to get the list of video modes your graphics card supports. The highest mode your monitor can display is preselected.
It is possible that your monitor cannot be detected automatically. In that case, select your preferred mode manually.
If your system has problems with the graphics card during the installation, the imo yokusebenza ngesiqendu may be a usable work-around.
