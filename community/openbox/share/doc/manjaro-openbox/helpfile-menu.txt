How to edit an Openbox menu
===========================

*********  It is strongly recommended you make a backup first!  *************

The Openbox menu does not auto-update, it needs to be edited by the user.

Either edit "~/.config/openbox/menu.xml" using a text editor or use the obconf gui:

Menu -> Settings -> Openbox -> GUI Menu Editor

(Links to more detailed info can be found in the Online Help for Openbox in the Help menu)


How To edit Manjaro pipemenu
================================

1)  For the Graphics, Multimedia and Browsers pipemenus:

Edit the pipemenu config file, which is "~/.config/openbox/pipemenus.rc"

Add/remove the application you want (NB there needs to be a space between each element).
The application name is the same as the package name.

For example, change the entries in the "Graphics" menu by editing the line:

GRAPHICS_APPS=('mirage' 'gimp' 'blender' 'inkscape' 'mandelbulber' 'viewnior')

OR

2)  Other menus, eg al-help-pipemenu, are in "/usr/bin/"

*** Remember that they could be over-written by a BL package upgrade,
    so use the following method instead of editing the file as root ***

1) Copy the file from /usr/bin to ~/bin (create directory if necessary).
2) Check ~/bin comes first in $PATH (use 'echo $PATH' to check)
3) Edit the local file

They have menu entries like:

menuItem 'Forum Basic Help & Support' 'x-www-browser "https://forums.ARCHlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=2"'

The first element is the label, the second is the command to be run

Recent Files Pipemenu
=====================

Run "al-recent-files-pipemenu -h" to show the usage of the command.

To change how the menu displays recent files, you can add the following switches
to the menu.xml pipemenu entry:

-r, --reverse       Put the most-recently used items at the top of the menu
-l, --limit NUM     Include up to NUM items in the menu

So to have the most recent 20 items displayed, with the newest first, use:

<menu execute="al-recent-files-pipemenu -r -l 20" id="pipe-recentfilesmenu" label="Recent Files"/>
