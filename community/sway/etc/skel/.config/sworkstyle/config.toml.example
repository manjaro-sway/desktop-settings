#
# pattern: Can either be the exact "app_name" (app_id/class) of the window or a regex string in the format of `"/{regex}/"` which will match the window "title".
# icon: Your beatiful icon
#
# verbose format:
#
# '{pattern}' = { type = 'generic' | 'exact', value = '{icon}' }
#
#
# If it couldn't match something it will print:
#
# WARN [sworkstyle:config] No match for '{app_name}' with title '{title}'
#
# You can use {title} to do a generic matching
# You can use {app_name} to do an exact match
# You can find icons for nerd fonts here: https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet
# Anything added in here will override the defaults in the package.
